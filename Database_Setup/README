Please use the create-todo-DB.sql code to genereate the database in PHPMyAdmin before using.

*Please note, The DATABASE USERNAME is "ToDoUser" and the DATABASE USER PASSWORD IS "ToDoUserPassword".
*This means you must either create that user if you do not have it in your database, or
*change ToDo_PHP/db_connection.php to reflect a user you like.
*Please see ToDo_PHP/db_connection.php if you are still confused.
